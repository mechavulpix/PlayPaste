PlayPaste is a simple, un-authenticated pastebin-like application. There are
plenty of these types of solutions available online currently, but I wrote one
anyway as an introduction to learning/using the Play Framework.

If you're familiar with play, setting this up on your server to host whatever
silly pastes that you don't want on pastebin should be simple.
